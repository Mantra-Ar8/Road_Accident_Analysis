# 🚦 Road Accidents in India — Analysis & Machine Learning Project

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accidents across India (2014) based on three major factors:
1️⃣ Lane / Road Type
2️⃣ Vehicle Type
3️⃣ Reason / Cause of Accident

It includes data cleaning, visual analytics, hypothesis-based comparisons, and machine learning models for predicting accident severity.

📊 Project Objectives

Understand which road types have the highest accident impact

Analyze accident contribution from different vehicle categories

Study the primary causes of accidents

Extract patterns from injuries, fatalities, and accident counts

Build ML models to classify accident severity (Low / Medium / High)

📁 Dataset Files

This project contains three datasets:

laneAccidents.csv — Lane-wise accidents

typeOfVehicle.csv — Vehicle-wise accidents

reasonOfAccident.csv — Cause-wise accidents

Each dataset is analyzed in its corresponding Python file
